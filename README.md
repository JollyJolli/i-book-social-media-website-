   cd api
   ```

3. **Build the API Docker Image**  
   Build the Docker image for the backend:
   ```bash
   docker build -t 'api-docker-image' .
   ```

4. **Run the API Container**  
   Start the backend container with the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8000:8000 'api-docker-image'
   ```

5. **Navigate to the Client Directory**
